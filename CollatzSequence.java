/**
 * The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a
 * sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each
 * term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is
 * even, the next term is one half the previous term. If the previous term is
 * odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is
 * that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.
